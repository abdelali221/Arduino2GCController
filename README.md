 A GC Controller emulator

This app is still in developement, and I'm not responsible for any damage that it could cause.
As long as you respect the wiring it should work with no problems.

# How to use :

# Control mapping : 

- A : "m"
- B : ":"
- X : "l"
- Y : ";"
- Z : "p"
- L : "a"
- R : "$"
- Dpad UP : "z"
- Dpad DOWN : "s"
- Dpad LEFT : "q"
- Dpad RIGHT : "d"
