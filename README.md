# Arduino2GCController
 A GC Controller emulator

This app is still in developement, and I'm not responsible for any damage that it could cause.
As long as you respect the wiring it should work with no problems.

# How to use :

Simply upload the program to your Arduino (IT SHOULD BE A 16MHZ BOARD), then follow the diagram :

# Control mapping : 

A : "m"
B : ":"
X : "l"
Y : ";"
Z : "p"
L : "a"
R : "$"
Dpad UP : "z"
Dpad DOWN : "s"
Dpad LEFT : "q"
Dpad RIGHT : "d"
